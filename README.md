# SimpleMultithreader Project

This project aims to simplify the programming effort required to parallelize algorithms using Pthreads. Inspired by the example of a parallel array sum discussed in Lecture 21, which had significantly more lines of code compared to its sequential counterpart, the **SimpleMultithreader** abstracts key programming complexities into a header-only library.

## Key Features

1. **Header-Only Implementation**: Provided as a single file (`simple-multithreader.h`) that programmers can include in their projects.
2. **Lambda-Based APIs**: Offers modern, C++11 lambda expression-based APIs for ease of use and readability.
3. **Simplifies Parallelization**: Reduces the effort required to write and manage Pthread-based parallel algorithms.
4. **Sample Programs**: Includes two sample C++ programs demonstrating the usage of the SimpleMultithreader.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the challenges of parallel programming using Pthreads.
- Explore C++11 lambda expressions for creating cleaner and more readable parallel algorithms.
- Gain hands-on experience with header-only library development and abstraction in C++.
